					The Intergovernmental Science-Policy
					Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
					Services (IPBES) defines ecosystem
					functioning as "the flow of energy and
					materials through the biotic and abiotic
					components of an ecosystem. It includes
					many processes such as biomass
					production, trophic transfer through
					plants and animals, nutrient cycling,
					water dynamics and heat transfer" (IPBES
					glossary, 2017).

					<li>
						In more concrete terms, de Groot et
						al. (2002) describe ecosystem
						functions as: the ability of natural
						components and processes to directly
						or indirectly provide goods (e.g.,
						timber, fruit, oxygen, water), and
						services (e.g., pest control, climate
						regulation) that satisfy human needs.
						These functions can also be labeled as
						ecosystem services (MEA, 2005).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="poppins md:text-xl">
					Further, de Groot et al. (2002) group
					ecosystem functions into these four main
					categories:
				</p>
				<p className="poppins md:text-xl">
					<strong>Regulation functions:</strong>
					<ul className="poppins space-y-4 lg:space-y-0 list-disc list-outside ml-6 md:text-xl px-4">
						<li>
							This group maintains the ecosystem
							and biosphere health. It provides
							many ecosystem services which
							benefit humans (e.g., clean air,
							water or soil). These functions
							generally regulate essential
							ecological processes, e.g., through
							bio-geochemical cycles.
						</li>
						<li>
							Examples of functions in this group
							are: gas or climate regulation,
							disturbance prevention, and water
							regulation, but also many more.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p className="poppins md:text-xl">
					<strong>Habitat functions:</strong>
					<ul className="poppins space-y-4 lg:space-y-0 list-disc list-outside ml-6 md:text-xl px-4">
						<li>
							This group of functions contributes
							to the conservation of biological
							and genetic diversity as well as
							evolutionary processes. They provide
							refuge and reproduction-habitats to
							wild flora and fauna.
						</li>
						<li>
							Examples of functions in this group
							are: gas or climate regulation,
							disturbance prevention, and water
							regulation, but also many more.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p className="poppins md:text-xl">
					<strong>Production functions:</strong>
					<ul className="poppins space-y-4 lg:space-y-0 list-disc list-outside ml-6 md:text-xl px-4">
						<li>
							The functions in this group are the
							production of a variety of
							carbohydrate structures by plants
							and other organisms. These can be
							used and/or consumed by different
							species. However, these goods are
							not limited to food, but can also be
							e.g., building materials, energy
							resources (e.g., fuel) or genetic
							material (for gene editing).
						</li>
						<li>
							Functions of this group can, for
							example, be the production of the
							already mentioned food or raw
							materials, but also medicinal or
							ornamental resources.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p className="poppins md:text-xl mb-4">
					<strong>Information functions: </strong>
					<ul className="poppins space-y-4 lg:space-y-0 list-disc list-outside ml-6 md:text-xl px-4">
						<li>
							Natural ecosystems contribute to the
							maintenance of human health. They
							can provide opportunities for
							reflection, spiritual enrichment,
							cognitive development, recreation
							and aesthetic experience.
						</li>
						<li>
							Exemplary functions from this group
							are recreation and (eco)tourism,
							scientific and educational
							information as well as spiritual and
							historic information, among others.
